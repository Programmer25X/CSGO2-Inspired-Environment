# CSGO2 Environment - Game Development (Level 3) Coursework

## Overview
As part of my **Game Development (Level 3) course** I was tasked to create a map for *Counter-Strike 2 (CS:GO 2)* using *Unity*. To design my environment I had to conduct research into the FPS games within the competitive scene to better understand how potential players could make use of weapons, cover and elevation effectively in my map. Creating this map allowed me to develop my understanding of *Unity* and how important lighting, elevation and flow are when designing a level.

## Features
- A 3D city environment tailored for the FPS genre, which the player can explore.
- Use of textures, assets and materials to convey a sense of realism.
- Lighting and a skybox to further enhance immersion and visibility.
- Post-processing effects to create the player's field-of-vision (FOV).
- Sound effects to reinforce the atmosphere and realism.

## Gained Skills
- **Blender**: Utilised *Image as Planes* to impliment the storefronts.
- **Unity**: Built the environment using prefabs, colliders, post-processing effects, lighting and a skybox.
- **Level Design**: Conducted research and applied my knowledge, considering cover, elevation changes and sightlines for balanced and entertaining gameplay.
- **Lighting and Atmosphere**: Experimented with baked, mixed and real-time lighting, alongside fog and environmental effects.
- **Testing & Iteration**: Conducted repeated playtesting and gathered player feedback to refine the flow, pacing and balance the map provides.

## Reflection 
This was my first larger-scaled 3D FPS environment project in *Unity*. Working on this project gave me valuable practical insight into how crucial *gameplay mechanics*, *player audience* and *atmosphere* are when designing and creating a level. Furthermore, when designing and creating the environment I built more confidence in using *Unity* and *Blender*, whilst also reinforcing my understanding of how important testing and iteration are when designing a product. I have since used these skills to work on other projects, some of which are more complex, such as ***The Departed***.

## Usage / Disclaimer
This repository contains a **video demonstration** and a **playable build** of the CS:GO 2 environment I created in *Unity*.  

- This build is provided for **educational and portfolio purposes only**.  
- Some assets (models, textures, sounds, images) were sourced from **Unity’s free asset packs, Quixel/Fab, and other third-party libraries** available at the time of development.  
- These assets are **not included in the repository** and I do not claim ownership of them.  
- All **level design, layout, integration, and implementation** work showcased in this project was carried out by me as part of my **Game Development (Level 3) coursework**.
