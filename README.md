# CSGO2 Environment - Game Development (Level 3) Coursework

## Overview
As part of my **Game Development (Level 3) course** I was tasked to create a map for Counter-Strike 2 (CS:GO 2) using *Unity*. To design my environment I had to conduct research into the FPS games within the competitive scene to better understand how potential players could make use of weapons, cover and elevation effectively in my map. Creating this map allowed me to develop my understanding of *Unity* and how important lighting, elevation and flow is when designing a level.
